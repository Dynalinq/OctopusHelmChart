# Octopus Helm Chart

This Helm chart deploys a HA Octopus cluster (or a standalone Octopus instance when the replica count is 1).

This project does not have a Helm chart repository yet. See the releases for chart downloads.

This chart uses the mssql-linux chart as a dependency. See https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/mssql-linux for details on configuring that chart.
